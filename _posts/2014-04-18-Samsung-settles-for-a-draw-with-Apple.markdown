###Samsung and Apple, the two technology titans of the world of Technology have finally come to sign truce.

Both these companies have a history of being involved in a high action mudslinging tussle, trading blow-after-blow over the ownership of the underlying technology that our phones contain.

The extreme intensity of the irritation can be judged through the late Apple founder Steve Jobs' *(in)*famous quote

>"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."

>"I'm Going to Destroy Android, Because It's a Stolen Product"

>"I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong."


>**Steve Jobs (Late)**

>*Apple founder*

Samsung being the champion of the Android arena was obviously the centre of attention for Apple not only for using Android, but also for allegedly sporting an iPhone like design, apart from infringing upon Apple patents.

Their court battles spanned several countries and continents, for years, each having an occassional victory only to be challenged in appeals or some other court. The deadlock seemed endless.

But after the announcement of truce, it seems sense has prevailed and the two giants may now kiss and tell...
