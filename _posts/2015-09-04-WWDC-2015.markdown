###Can Apple CEO Tim Cook wow us next week?

##Apple!!


Can you feel the difference, can't you?
The excitement that once gripped you as hype built for the next Apple iPhone event -- it isn't quite there anymore.
Call it smartphone fatigue.

Smartphone makers used to wow us with a sharper display or a crisper camera. Now we're seeing incremental updates that leave us flat. It's a dilemma facing the broader industry as the smartphone market matures and begins to slow. Witnessed by how Samsung has struggled despite cranking out new Galaxy smartphones, or how sales at HTC tumbled after that company released its flagship One smartphone with minimal physical changes.
There may be no better poster child for this problem than the upcoming iPhone.

When Apple unveils its next iPhone -- believed to be the iPhone 6S -- on Wednesday, the device is expected to look exactly like last year's model. And that one, the iPhone 6, looked a lot like the first smartphone Apple introduced eight years ago. While consumers are now conditioned to expect minor changes during the off-year "S" model iPhones, it's unclear just how Apple will get consumers pumped up again.

The likely marquee feature for this year's iPhone 6S will be the *Force Touch* technology used in the Apple Watch -- a pressure-sensitive display that responds to various types of touches. A new color could be in the works as well. Some rumors say Apple may tweak the device's display and materials and slightly alter the design to incorporate a bigger battery (much needed).
But the odds of the iPhone 6S looking radically different from every iPhone that has preceded it are slim to none. Force Touch doesn't seem as though it would resonate the way digital voice assistant Siri or a fingerprint sensor did when they debuted during an "S" year.
Our boredom doesn't mean Apple won't sell millions of phones, but it does mean consumers may think a little longer before shelling out cash for an iPhone 6S when their old devices are "good enough."

Fortunately for Apple, it may not need the iPhone to carry the day. If recent reports are to be believed, next week's event in San Francisco could be one of the most jam-packed launches Apple has ever hosted. Along with showing off new smartphones, Apple likely will introduce new iPads -- possibly including the long-awaited 12.9-inch *iPad Pro* -- and an updated *Apple TV*, as well as possibly providing *Mac*, *Apple Watch* and other news. It also will launch its *iOS 9* and *Mac OS X El Capitan* software, first shown in June.
