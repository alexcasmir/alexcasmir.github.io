After a long 18-months of silence, Windows Phone seems a step closer to a software upgrade on Monday as Microsoft released test versions of it's upcoming 8.1 version of the Windows Phone operating system to developers.

Unlike standard issue developer versions however, end consumers can download and run the latest edition of Windows Phone on their mobile device -- with a catch, that they're willing to void the phone's carrier warranty until their carriers adopt the upgrade.

There are several new features in the new Windows Phone  which mimic or are similar to those of major mobile operating systems, Android and iOS.

Features like "shade", that can be pulled down to view recent notifications  and a speaking digital assistant are already in Android and iOS, Word Flow, too, is similar to the Android app Swype.

With WP 8.1, Microsoft has improved the home screen by increasing the number of live tile columns, adding transparency to the tiles, and allowing them to be re-sized at will. In addition, a user can specify a photo of his or her own choice as a background for the tiles.

Connecting to a wireless hotspots should be easier with Wi-Fi Sense, a feature that automatically connects to free hotspots and networks previously logged into, which again is similar to known networks feature found in iDevices and Androids.

The new version of Windows Phone offers tools for managing data, storage and power. Data Sense provides a picture of data use and offer solutions for conserving it. Storage Sense helps manage storage on a phone, making recommendations when data can be transferred to an external SD card. Battery Saver can extend battery life by shutting down all but essential features to conserve precious battery juice.

Microsoft has also added its own digital assistant, Cortana, to the new Windows Phone OS. Taking cues from Siri, the apple personal assistant, analysts are having a lot of expectations from Cortana.

On the enterprise front, Microsoft is seen filling in the gap between the consumer features of Windows Phone and the needs of the enterprise.

Microsoft with WP 8.1 seems to be making a desperate comeback attempt towards the businesses, adding VPN support, secure WiFi support, and S/MIME support for email.

Although developers and brave consumers will have access to Windows Phone 8.1 this week, only time will tell how the market treats this new iteration of Windows Phone...
